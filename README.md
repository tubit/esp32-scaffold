# nodeMCU scaffold 
This is just my Arduino scaffold, boilerplate or whatever you want to call it.

I started just recently with a ESP32 Dev Kit V2 from AZ-Delivery and was amazed what was possible with almost no effort. But instead of just copy and pasting stuff from all over the internet, I wanted to get some structure into it... :)

So this is my starting point for new and fresh from the box nodeMCU - just having wifi setup with WiFiManager[1] and the ability to install over-the-air firmware updates.

I've build and prepared this within VS Code and the PlatformIO plugin. I liked the setup and the integrations. So it might help you, if you use the same environment. Just follow their readme to setup your environment, I followed a Blog post from Hendirk[2] (in german, sorry). But I am sure you will be able to find something else to follow. It's easy.

And now have fun.

## Used Hardware
I currently use ESP32 Dev Kit V2 boards from AZ-Delivery[3]
